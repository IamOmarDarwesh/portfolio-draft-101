Hi there 👋, 


Let me introduce myself. 



I'm Omar Darwesh.


I'm a Computer Science postgraduate with an analytical mindset and enthusiasm for **Data Analysis**, **Analytics Engineering**, and **Data Engineering**.

On a typical day, I worked on developing deliverables such as presentations, dashboards, and reports using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **PowerPoint**, **Figma**, and others as needed.

My workflow usually started with exploring and understanding the data—assessing its quality, identifying any issues, and defining suitable approaches to address them. Once the data challenges were tackled and multiple sources were integrated where necessary, I moved on to the design phase.

I began by sketching and shaping the structure of dashboards and reports, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also informative and purposeful. From there, I built comprehensive dashboards that clearly presented **KPIs** and performance metrics aligned with business objectives.

A key focus throughout was making insights easily understandable for **non-technical stakeholders**, so that data-driven decisions could be made with clarity and confidence.

I know what you're thinking right now. You wanna see a couple of interactive dashboard/report samples.

Kindly have a look at a few Reports/Dashboards for interactive insights I built with **Power BI**:
