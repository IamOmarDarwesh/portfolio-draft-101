Hi there 👋, 


Let me introduce myself. 



I'm Omar Darwesh.


I'm a Computer Science postgraduate with an analytical mindset and enthusiasm for **Data Analysis**, **Analytics Engineering**, and **Data Engineering**.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Technical Experience
<br>

### **Data Science Trainee** 
#### at ALX Africa, Egypt
*Duration: 1.5 years*

![ALX Afric](assets/imgs-experiences/alx-africa.jpg)

- Worked on multiple assignments with tight deadlines.
- Gained expertise in **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and other key data analysis tools.


<br>
<br>

### **Data Analysis Trainee** 
#### at Information Technology Institute (ITI), Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), Egypt
*Duration: 5 months*

![ITI Logo](assets/imgs-experiences/ITI.png)

- Acquired advanced skills in **data cleaning**, **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **reporting**.
- Worked with a variety of tools such as **SQL**, **Excel**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and more.

<br>
<br>

On a typical day, I worked on developing deliverables such as presentations, dashboards, and reports using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **PowerPoint**, **Figma**, and others as needed.

My workflow usually started with exploring and understanding the data—assessing its quality, identifying any issues, and defining suitable approaches to address them. Once the data challenges were tackled and multiple sources were integrated where necessary, I moved on to the design phase.

I began by sketching and shaping the structure of dashboards and reports, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also informative and purposeful. From there, I built comprehensive dashboards that clearly presented **KPIs** and performance metrics aligned with business objectives.

A key focus throughout was making insights easily understandable for **non-technical stakeholders**, so that data-driven decisions could be made with clarity and confidence.

I know what you're thinking right now. You wanna see a couple of interactive dashboard/report samples.

Kindly have a look at a few Reports/Dashboards for interactive insights I built with **Power BI**:

- Focused on **SDG 6.1.1 – Access to Safely Managed Drinking Water**, aiming to ensure clean and safe water for all in Maji Ndogo.  
- Connected to a **MySQL database** and conducted deep **SQL-based exploration, cleaning, and transformation** of water source data directly in **Jupyter Notebook**, with light Python support for additional processing.
  
- Used **Power BI** to visualize insights and craft **data storytelling dashboards** for long-term impact tracking and transparent decision-making.  
- Designed dashboard mockups and story flow in **Figma and PowerPoint** to align visuals with the analytical narrative.  
- Discovered that only **33% (≈9M of 28M people)** had access to safe drinking water and identified urgent action zones.  
- Revealed over **25,000 contaminated or failing water sources** requiring immediate attention and categorized issues by source type (tap, well, shared tap, river).  
- Prioritized interventions for **most vulnerable regions**, implementing **quick temporary fixes** and **long-term sustainable solutions**.  
- Exposed broader social issues like **crime risks** for women and children traveling long distances for water, emphasizing the human dimension of data.  
- Delivered actionable insights that guided new wells, repairs, and equitable water distribution — improving quality of life and community resilience.  
- Achieved a **transformative impact**, with **~18 million people** gaining access to clean water and living conditions improving significantly.
