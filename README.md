Hi there 👋, 

Let me introduce myself. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Omar Darwesh.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a Computer Science postgraduate with an analytical mindset and a deep enthusiasm for

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Data Analysis** & **Analytics Engineering**.

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Technical Experience
<br>

## **Data Science Trainee** 
### at ALX Africa, Egypt
*Duration: 1.5 years*

![ALX Afric](assets/imgs-experiences/alx-africa.jpg)

- Worked on multiple assignments with tight deadlines.
  
- Gained expertise in **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, and other key data analysis tools.

<br>
<br>

## **Data Analysis Trainee** 
### at Information Technology Institute (ITI), Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), Egypt
*Duration: 5 months*

![ITI Logo](assets/imgs-experiences/ITI.png)

- Acquired advanced skills in **data cleaning**, **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **reporting**.
  
- Worked with a variety of tools such as **SQL**, **Excel**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and more.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

- I primarily worked on developing a variety of deliverables such as presentations, dashboards, and reports using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **Google Slides**, **PowerPoint**, **Figma**, and others as needed.

    - My workflow usually started with exploring and understanding the data — assessing its quality, identifying any issues, and defining suitable approaches to address them.

    - Once the data challenges were resolved and multiple sources were integrated when necessary, I moved on to the design phase.

        - Here, I began by sketching and shaping the structure of dashboards and reports, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also clear, informative, purposeful, and aligned with user needs.

        - From there, I built comprehensive dashboards and reports that clearly presented **KPIs** and performance metrics aligned with business objectives.

- A key focus throughout was making insights easily understandable for all kinds of audiences, especially **non-technical stakeholders**, so that data-driven decisions could be made with clarity and confidence.

<br>
<br>

In **Jupyter Notebook**, **Google Colab** & **VS Code**, I performed data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python and others, as well as documented each step of the workflow.

<br>
<br>
<br>

I used  **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, **Google Sheets** for Exploring and Cleaning data existing in files like CSVs and databases like Microsoft SQL Server & MySQL.

[![MySQL](assets/imgs-tools&technologies/mysql.svg)](https://www.mysql.com/)

<br>
<br>
<br>

I used **Figma**, **PowerPoint** and **draw.io** for Sketching and Designing wireframes and dashboards/reports, and visualizing report structures.

<br>

[![draw.io](assets/imgs-tools&technologies/draw-io.svg)](https://www.diagrams.net/)

<br>
<br>
<br>

I experienced different visualization tools like **Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, and Python**.

<br>

<br>

I know what you're thinking right now. You wanna see a couple of interactive dashboard/report samples.

Kindly have a look at a few Reports/Dashboards for interactive insights I built with **Power BI**:

# Current Professional Development Focus

You might be wondering what I’ve been up to lately.


I’ve been focused on learning/mastering tools like **Fivetran**, **Airbyte**, **Airflow**, **dbt**, **BigQuery**, and **Metabase** through hands-on experience.


Working to get comfortable with the full data pipeline, with a particular focus on mastering **data transformation**, alongside **data ingestion**, **warehousing**, **orchestration**, and **analytics**.
